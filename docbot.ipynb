A hiatal hernia is an outpouching of part of the stomach upwards through the diaphragm, can cause the symptoms you’re describing, and can be fixed surgically. \n",

Rubbing vicks on your stomach won't relieve it. The cramping is coming from inside from your gut. The dizziness is probably a vagal response to the bowel movements. You need to stay well hydrated (with something like gatorade that has sugar/salt and water) and stay close to the toilet. You will likely have more episodes of diarrhea until it fully resolves. You may also have some vomiting too.\n",

You may eventually be referred to GI, but for now I think your PCP would be a good place to start. ,No problem! I don't think you need to put yourself through any misery by inducing the pain though. As best you can remember, how long after the stomach pain starts do you get the diarrhea? ,No worries! That is interesting. Since it has been so long, what I would do is see if you can reproduce the symptoms one time, for all you know it may not even happen. Just to be on the safe side, if you choose to try make sure you're not alone. The symptoms you've described could be a lot of things, but without a more discriptive/accurate account  and lacking a physical exam its hard to tell. \n",
